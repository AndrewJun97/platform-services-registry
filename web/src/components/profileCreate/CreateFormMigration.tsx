        As the capacity in the Silver cluster remains to be an issue due to the slow progress of the
        app migration, the priority will be given to provisioning namespaces for the projects that:
        <blockquote>
          <br /> a) migrate from OCP3 and
          <br /> b) have short 2-3 week migration timelines starting from when the namespaces are
          provisioned.
        </blockquote>
        Please indicate in the project description field if your project meets the two criteria
        above and include the license plate number for the OCP3 project set.
      </FormSubtitle>
