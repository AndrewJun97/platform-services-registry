        After hitting request, our smart robots will start working hard behind the scenes. There is
        one step, the approval process, where a human is involved. They'll take the opportunity, if
        needed, to reach out and have an on-boarding conversation with you.

        Also, look out for our Notification emails that will provide you with valuable information
        regarding your project status and details.
